<hr><center><b>Objective</b><hr><br>
First objective: Capture British Somaliland.<br><br></center>
To achieve this you need to do a few things:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Move around the map: Hold right mouse button and drag.</li>
	<li>Find Somalia...</li>
	<li>Select the Infantry: Left mouse click on the unit.</li>
	<li>Move it to British Somaliland.</li>
	<li>Drop the Infantry: Left mouse click to drop.</li>
	<li>When captured the territory will change color to dark brown.</li>

</ul>
TripleA has a few more options to move around the map and select units:<br>
Have a look in the <em><b>Help</b></em>-tab (top-left of your screen).<br>
Look in the <em><b>Movement/Selection help</b></em>-section.<br>
Try out the different options and find one you like best.<br>
Tip: Using the minimap to move around on the big map works great!<br><br><br>
<center><b>Captured British Somaliland?</b></center><br>
Then go to the <em><b>Actions</b></em>-tab and click <em><b>Done</b></em>.<br>
<br><hr><br>
<center><b>New unit info</b></center><br>
So you got yourselves a brand new Tank hey?<br>
If you want to get some info on your new units you have a few options:<br>
<ul>
<li>Have a look in the <em><b>Help</b></em>-tab (top-left of your screen).<br>
Look in the <em><b>Unit help</b></em>-section (more detailed info).</li>
<li>Hover the mouse over the unit and press <em><b>V</b></em> or <em><b>I</b></em>.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><center><b>Objective</b></center><hr><br>
Second objective: Capture Kenya, Ethiopia and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.<br><br>
If you use your Infantry to capture Ethiopia and your Tank to capture the other two territories you can do this in just one turn!<br><br>
The white territories (like Egypt) are Neutral and cannot be attacked.<br><br>
Done? Again go to the <em><b>Actions</b></em>-tab and click <em><b>Done</b></em>.<br><br>

<hr><center><b>Objective</b><hr><br>
First objective: Attack Slovakia Hungary!<br><br></center>
Move the 2 Infantry from Germany to Slovakia Hungary for the attack. Use the Tank to blitz Greater Southern Germany and join the attack in Slovakia Hungary! But wait...<br><br>
Before starting battle first check below how battles work in TripleA.
<br><br>
<center><b>Battle</b></center><br><br>
<img src="Battle1.png"/><br><br>
This is the Battle window.<br>
The attacker (Germany) fires first. For each unit a die is rolled.<br><br>
Infantry have an Attack power of 1 which means each rolled 1 is a hit. In the above example both Infantry missed (rolled 3 and 2).<br>
Tanks have an Attack power of 3. So for each 1, 2, or 3 they score a hit (50% chance).<br>
In this case the Tank rolled a 3 thus a hit. The enemy Infantry is hit, but still has a chance to return fire, see the picture below.<br><br>
<img src="Battle2.png"/><br>
The enemy Infantry was hit, but still has a defense roll.<br>
Infantry has a Defense power of 2, so each 1 or 2 scores a hit (33%).<br>
In this case it scored a defensive hit (2) and now Germany has to select a casualty. Select an Infantry as casualty because it is the cheaper and weaker unit.<br><br>
If neither side won the battle you have the option to continue fighting or retreat. When retreating, all units retreat to one territory where at least one attacking unit came from. So in this case you can retreat to either Germany or Greater Southern Germany.<br><br>
To continue click <em><b>Actions >> Done</b></em><br><br>
<div style="margin:10px;padding:10px;border:1px solid black;">
<center><b>Can't find the Battle window?</b></center><br>
The Battle window (among others) is a pop-up window separate from the main TripleA window. If it disappears, you can find it again using one of the following approaches:
<ul>
  <li>On Windows and Linux distros that have a taskbar, you can find an icon for the Battle window on the taskbar (usually at the bottom of your screen).</li>
  <li>Otherwise, use your window manager to search or cycle through the background windows until you find the Battle window. Simply minimizing the main TripleA window may reveal the Battle window immediately.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br><hr><center><b>Objective</b><hr><br>
Second objective: Capture Poland!<br><br></center>
Poland is better defended so you will need more units.<br><br>
If you doubt your attacking army is strong enough you can use the <em><b>Battle Calculator</b></em>. This useful tool gives you a good indication of your chance of success in battle.<br><br>
To use the Battle Calculator:
<ul>
	<li>Move all attacking units to the target territory.</li>
	<li>Hover the mouse over the target territory.</li>
	<li>Press <em><b>CTRL+B</b></em>.</li>
	<li>In the Battle Calculator window press <em><b>Calculate Odds</b></em>.</li>
	<li>The top-right number is your chance of success.</li>
	<li>If you don't like your odds you can <em><b>Undo</b></em> your Combat Moves.</li>
</ul>
<em><b>Note:</b></em> The Battle Calculator gives you a chance of success, but no guarantee! After all, this is a game with Dice!<br><br>

<br><hr><center><b>Italian Objective</b><hr><br>
Weaken the British by destroying their economic base in Africa and the Middle-East.<br><br></center>
By doing this you will support Germany in its fight against the British.<br>
You will also gain a strong economic base for future military adventures.<br><br>
Make sure the Italian Navy rules the Mediterranean. This will allow you to transport units to Africa. Capturing Egypt is the key to Victory!<br>
<br><hr><center><b>German Objective</b><hr><br>
Destroy <b>all</b> British Naval vessels in the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea.<br><br></center>
By building a strong Navy and taking on the British you can prevent British amphibious landings in Europe. Keep them locked up on their island! You can retreat to safety in the Baltic Sea if necessary.<br>
<br><hr><br>
<center><b>Straits & Canals</b></center><br>
<ul>
	<li>These are narrow seaways limiting passage of ships.</li>

<br><hr><center><b>Objective</b><hr><br>
Capture all three Russian Production Territories:<br>Novgorod, Rostov and the Capital Russia!<br><br></center>
Build a powerful army to overwhelm the Russians.<br>
Gaining the upper hand in the Baltic Sea will allow you to strike fast and by surprise. Capturing Novgorod quickly will deny the enemy use of its Factory and allow you to produce troops close to Russia.<br><br>
Italy can attack through Romania and Ukraine.<br>
Capturing Turkey opens up a new route into Southern Russia and the Turkish Straits for your Navy to move through. The Italian navy can then launch surprise attacks behind enemy lines and reinforce troops on the frontline quickly.<br><br>
